This script does exactly what ShutUp10++ does. My goal is to remove the question marks in your mind and make the code more transparent and secure by making it open source.

> [!NOTE]  
> The legacy version of Microsoft Edge is not included in the script as it is no longer used.

## Start the script

```powershell
